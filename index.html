        Best Foods and Drinks, In My Opinion
    </h1>
    <p id="intro"> What's your favorite food? I have so many! So, I made this HTML project to tell you what they are, and why they are my favorite foods and drinks. </p>
<h2>Apple Juice</h2>
<p> It's sweet, but not too sweet! If you put ice in it, it's refreshing! Also, you can usually get it on planes, so it's not rare. It's also made out of apples, so it's healthy.</p>
<h2>Spaghetti and Meatballs</h2>
<p>The dish spaghetti and meatballs is awesome! Most people like spaghetti, but most people think it's bland. So you add meatballs and sauce! It makes the spaghetti saltier and more savory, too.</p>
    </body>
    <h2>Ham/Turkey Sandwich</h2>
    <p> They're really simple and easy to make! Just get some bread, cheese, lettuce, ham(or turkey), and some mayo. Combine them and wala! You've got yourself an awesome sandwich! Not only are they easy to make, they can be customized. You can add more lettuce or less lettuce. More cheese, or no cheese!(Though cheese is one of the best parts of the sandwich.) </p>
